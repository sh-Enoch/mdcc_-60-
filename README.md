# 60 Days Django Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **60-day Django Learning Journey**! ðŸŒŸ

For the next 60 days, Iâ€™ve committed to spending **at least 1 hour a day** focused on mastering Django.

Let's break down the learning process into manageable steps, tackle daily challenges, and build real-world projects along the way.

## **Whatâ€™s this Journey About?**

This journey is all about getting hands-on experience with Django, the powerful web framework for Python. Over the next 60 days, Iâ€™ll be focusing on building practical skills, understanding core concepts, and diving deep into Django's features to develop a well-rounded understanding of web development.

### **Key Goals:**
- **Master Djangoâ€™s core concepts** like models, views, and templates.
- **Work with Djangoâ€™s admin interface** to manage app data easily.
- **Learn Django Rest Framework** to build robust APIs.
- **Understand authentication and user management** to secure applications.
- **Deploy a Django app** to a real server.

## **Daily Commitments** ðŸŽ¯

Iâ€™ve set myself a challenge to spend **at least 1 hour per day** focusing solely on Django. During these 60 days, I'll be working on various tutorials, building projects, and exploring advanced Django concepts. Each day, Iâ€™ll be tackling a new task and pushing my progress to GitHub.

### **Hereâ€™s what the 8 weeks will look like:**
